Use https://www.draw.io/ and create some diagrams showing the difference
between prototype and __proto__ in Javascript.

So few books use pictures to describe how __proto__ is used for inheritence
or the fact that creating a function results in *two* separate objects: one
for the function and one for a prototype object that is referenced (linked to)
by the function object.
