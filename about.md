My name is Todd Hayton and I'm a freelance software developer living in the DC metro area. I've been programming professionally
since 2001, and freelancing since 2010. My professional background is predominantly in C and Python:

* C (14 years) - Systems development, BSD sockets, embedded development
* Python (4 years) - Django web development, web/data-scraping

Since 2012, I've run <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neekanee.com">Neekanee.com</a>, an international job search engine that 
I built from scratch (using Python/Django) that scrapes jobs directly from company web sites. At present, it collects over 90k 
jobs from over 100 countries.
